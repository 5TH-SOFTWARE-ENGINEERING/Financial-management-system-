The frontend/app/variance directory implements the Variance Analysis module, which is used to measure and analyze the gap between your Budgeted targets and Actual financial performance.

Key Functions:
Variance Calculation (/calculatevariance): Compares actual revenue and expenses against budgeted amounts for a specific period to identify "Favorable" or "Unfavorable" discrepancies.
Performance History (/variancehistory): Tracks how these discrepancies evolve over time, allowing for long-term trend analysis.
Executive Summary (/variancesummery): Provides a high-level dashboard view of performance across all periods with aggregated statistics.
