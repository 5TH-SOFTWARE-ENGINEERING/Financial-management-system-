The frontend/app/scenarios directory is a powerful Financial Simulation and "What-If" Analysis module. It allows users to create and compare different financial outcomes based on a base budget, modeling how changes in revenue or expenses might impact the organization's bottom line.

Key Functions and Features:
"What-If" Simulation (/create):
Baseline Modeling: Select an existing budget and apply percentage-based adjustments (e.g., "What if revenue increases by 10%?" or "What if marketing expenses double?").
Categorized Adjustments: Apply specific multipliers or flat-amount changes to individual revenue and expense categories.
Outcome Comparison (/compare):
Visual Side-by-Side: Compare multiple scenarios (e.g., Best Case vs. Worst Case) against the actual baseline budget.
Delta Analysis: Instantly see the difference in Total Revenue, Total Expenses, and Net Profit across different modeled futures.
Scenario Management (/list):
Lifecycle Tracking: Scenarios are categorized by type (Best Case, Worst Case, Most Likely, Custom) for easy identification.
Search & Filter: Quickly find simulations linked to specific budgets or departments.
Secure Administration: Just like budgets, deleting a simulation scenario requires administrator password verification to prevent accidental data loss.
Strategic Decision Support:
Profitability Modeling: Helps leadership determine the viability of new projects or departmental expansions before committing real funds.
Risk Assessment: Models "Worst Case" scenarios to ensure the company has enough runway during downturns.
